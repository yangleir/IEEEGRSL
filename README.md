# IEEE GRSL

I make the data in following paper freely aviable to public:

Z. Lin, Y. Lei, X. Yongsheng, Y. Fanlin, and Z. Xinghua, “Retrieving wave parameters with PPP mode from GNSS buoy measurements,” IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. Under Review, 2020.

I wish it would be useful for people who have interests in this domain.

# Data link

Because the data is in big size, I upload them to the cloud intead of Github.

## GF-1 optical image
This is the original GF-1 data used in our paper. Before applying to wave retrieving, some pre-processing intruduced in the paper should be considered.

# About tide gauge data
The tide gauge data in China is managed as confidential, which is hard to apply. If we got the data, it is also dangerous (maybe loss job) to make the tide gauge data opening to public. Deep sorry about this.
