## GF-1 optical image
This is the original GF-1 data used in our paper. Before applying to wave retrieving, some pre-processing intruduced in the paper should be considered.

# About tide gauge data
The tide gauge data in China is managed as confidential, which is hard to apply. If we got the data, it is also dangerous (maybe loss job) to make the tide gauge data opening to public. Deep sorry about this.
